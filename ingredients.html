          <p>
            Researchers believe Puebla, located in South Central Mexico, to be
            the motherland of the avocado, where this strange and delicious
            fruit first flourished and locals began consuming them nearly 10,000
            years ago. Since then, the avocado never looked back. With the
            rising popularity of Mexican cuisine over the last several decades
            and a population more knowledgeable than ever on how to live longer,
            nutritious-filled lives, the avocado has firmly established itself
            as a widely popular everyday dietary supplement.

          <h2 class="ingredient_name">Lime</h2>
          <p>
            In Mexico, the lime — known as a limón — is everywhere, served with
            nearly all food except coffee and dessert (and some desserts are
            made with them) and sold in even the smallest neighborhood stores.
            Here, limes are considered a necessity, and almost no kitchen is
            without them. Wedges of lime accompany everything from morning
            plates of fruit to late night tacos, and are served with salads,
            seafood cocktails, fish dishes, grilled beef, soups, and even snacks
            like roasted peanuts.

          <h2 class="ingredient_name">Chilli</h2>
          <p>
            Many people think of chillies as having one simple purpose: they add
            heat. So does it really matter which one you choose? In Mexico, this
            question is borderline offensive. With over 150 varieties available
            across the country, and thousands of ways to prepare them, Mexicans
            carefully select their chile to not only add heat, but also, and
            most importantly, to add heaps of flavor to their dishes. Whether
            it’s sweet, fruity, smoky, earthy or hot, the chillies forms the
            base of every meal here, and has even become part of Mexico’s
            national identity.

        <article class="ingredients_text cilantro_text">
          <h2 class="ingredient_name">Cilantro</h2>
          <p>
            Perhaps no other herb defines Mexican cuisine better than cilantro,
            otherwise known as fresh coriander, and Chinese or Mexican parsley.
            Indeed, no self-respecting Mexican salsa is complete without a touch
            of chopped cilantro. Neither is a Vietnamese spring roll, a Moroccan
            stew, nor a bowl of Thai noodle soup. Yet, many still label this
            ubiquitous herb as “exotic,” and it remains a relative unknown to a
            majority of cooks.

            The versatility of maize (Corn) is difficult to overstate, used to
            create ethanol fuel, cornstarch, grain alcohol, animal feed, and an
            endless array of delicious dishes throughout the world. Though the
            crop has been embraced by a number of different regions, it remains
            a key component in the cuisine of its birthplace. Mexican food is
            often quite literally built upon the tortilla. It's the vehicle by
            which the country's most popular edible exports are delivered:
            enchiladas, quesadillas, tacos, tamales, tlacoyos. Though wheat
            flour has grown in popularity in the world -- home of the burrito --
            in Mexico, it's all about the maize.
